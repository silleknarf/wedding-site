README
======

The technical goal of the project was to build a wedding website with very good performance. As it's a static site and there is no advanced functionality required, there was an early design decision to not use any major JS frameworks (i.e. Angular/React) and to go down the pure HTML and CSS route as much as possible. 

The site wass hosted on S3 with CloudFront used for content delivery, it's now hosted using GH pages at https://silleknarf.github.io/wedding-site/.

The original URL was https://frankandlaura.wedding but we've now taken that down.
